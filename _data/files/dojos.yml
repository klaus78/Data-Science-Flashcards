  question: >
    Given the conditional tree in the picture in the answer, find the probabilities 
    P(Cake|Coffee), P(Cake'&cap;Coffee), P(Cake), P(Coffee|Cake).
  answer: >
    P(Cake|Coffee), can be read directly from the conditional diagram.
    <br><b>P(Cake|Coffee) = (3/4)</b>
    <br><br>
    To find P(Cake' &cap; Coffee), we use the formula of the conditional probability.
    <br><b>P(Cake' &cap; Coffee) = P(Cake'|Coffee) * P(Coffee) = (1/4) * (2/3) = 1/6</b>
    <br><br>
    To find P(Cake), we need to add P(Cake &cap; Coffee) and P(Cake &cap; Coffee')
    <br><b>P(Cake) = P(Cake &cap; Coffee) + P(Cake &cap; Coffee') = P(Cake|Coffee) * P(Coffee) + P(Cake|Coffee') * P(Coffee')
    = (3/4)*(2/3) + (3/5)*(1/3) = 1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10 = 0.7</b>
    <br><br>
    To find P(Coffee|Cake), we use the formula for the conditional probability and P(Cake) found previously.
    <br><b>P(Coffee|Cake) = P(Coffee &cap; Cake) / P(Cake) = P(Cake|Coffee) * P(Coffee) / P(Cake) = (3/4) * (2/3) / (7/10) = 1/2 * 10/7 = 0.71</b>

- question: >
    Given 10 people, 7 people likes coffe, 5 likes tea, 4 people likes both. 
    Are the probabilities P(coffee) and P(tea) dependent or independent?
  answer: >
    P(coffee) and P(tea) are independent if P(coffee) x P(tea) = P(coffee &cap; tea).
    <br><br>Let's check whether this is the case or not.
    <b><br><br>P(coffee) = 7/10 = 0.7
    <br>P(tea) = 5/10 = 0.5
    <br>P(coffee &cap; tea) = 4 / 10 = 0.4
    <br>P(coffee) x P(tea) = 0.7 x 0.5 = 0.35</b>
    <br><br>Because P(coffee) x P(tea) is different from P(coffee &cap; tea), it follows that 
    P(coffee) and P(tea) are <u>dependent</u> events.

- question: >
    At a local shop you can buy magic boxes that can contain some money prizes. The box costs 1$. The probability
    of winning 5$ is 0.07 and the probability of winning 10$ is 0.03. If X is the net gain, what is
    the probability distribution P(X)? What are the values of the expectation E(X) and the variance Var(X)?
    How do P(X), E(X) and Var(X) change if the price of a magic box is increased to 1.5$?
  answer: >
    The possible values are -1$ (buying a magic box without winning), 4$ (buying a magic box and winning 5$) and 
    9$ (buying a magic box and winning 10$).
    The <b>probability distribution P(X)</b> is given by all possible values (-1, 7, 14) and their probabilities
    (0.9, 0.07, 0.03). 
    <br><br>
    The <b>expectation E(X)</b> is<br>
    <b>E(X) = &mu; = -1*0.9 + 4*0.07 + 9 * 0.03 = -0.9 + 0.28 + 0.27 = -0.35</b>
    <br> The expected long term net gain is -0.35$
    <br><br>
    The <b>variance Var(X)</b> is<br>
    <b>Var(X) = (-1+0.35)<sup>2</sup>*0.9 + (4+0.35)<sup>2</sup>*0.07 + (9+0.35)<sup>2</sup>*0.03 
    = 0.38 + 1.32 + 2.62 = 4.32$</b>
    <br><br>
    If the price of the magic box is increased to 1.5$, the values change but the probabilities remain the same.
    The new data distribution Y can then be obtained from a linear transformation of the original data distribution as follows
    <br>
    <b>P(Y) = aP(X) + b.</b> 
    <br>
    In this example a = 1 and b = 0.5. E(Y) and Var(Y) can be then computed as 
    <br><br>
    <b>E(Y) = a E(X) + b = -0.35 + 0.5 = 0.15$</b>
    <br>
    <b>Var(Y) = a<sup>2</sup>Var(X) = 4.32$</b>

- question: >
    Given a restaurant 1 with prices (3$, $4$, 5$) and probability (0.6, 0.3, 0.1) and a restaurant 2 with prices (2$, 6$, 7$) and
    probability (0.8, 0.15, 0.05), what is the difference in price between the two restaurants?
  answer: >
    The average price for each restaurant is
    <br><b>E(R1) = 3*0.6 + 4*0.3 + 5*0.1 = 3.5$
    <br><br>E(R2) = 2*0.8 + 6.0.15 + 7*0.05 = 2.85$</b>
    <br><br>The variance of the price is 
    <br><b>Var(R1) = (3-3.5)<sup>2</sup>*0.6 + (4-3.5)<sup>2</sup>*0.3 + (5-3.5)<sup>2</sup>*0.1 = 0.45
    <br>Var(R2) = (2-2.85)<sup>2</sup>*0.8 + (6-2.85)<sup>2</sup>*0.15 + (7-2.85)<sup>2</sup>*0.05 = 2.93
    </b>
    <br><br>
    The difference in price between the two restaurant and the respective variance is
    <br><b>E(R1 - R2) = E(R1) - E(R2) = 3.5 - 2.85 = 0.65$ 
    <br>Var(R1 - R2) = Var(R1) + Var(R2) = 0.45 + 2.93 = 3.38</b>   

- question: >
    There is a race between 12 Ferrari cars, 8 Mercedes cars and 5 Lamborghini cars. What is the probability
    that the 5 Lamborghini cars will finish the race consecutively? Suppose that each Lamborghini has the same probability
    of winning.
  answer:
    We are not interested in the order of the individual cars but on the car type at each position. Since the Lamborghini
    cars are at consecutive positions, they can be treated as a single item. We need to find the number of ways in which
    the 5 Lamborghini cars can finish the race consecutively. We also need to find the number of ways the race can be finished
    irrespective of the car types.  
    We use the formula for computing the number of arrangements of k objects where j and k of them are of the same type

      <span class="symbol">/</span>

- question: >
    The probability of winning a game is 0.2. Can you find
    <ul>
    <li>the probability you will succeed at your 5th attempt after 4 failures</li>
    <li>the probability you will succeed in 7 or less attempts</li>
    <li>the probability you will need more than 7 attempts to succeed</li>
    <li>the expected number of attempts you need to succeed</li>
    <li>the variance of the expected number of attempts you need to succeed</li>
    </ul>
  answer: >
    This is an example of geometric distribution because we have a set of independent trials. 
    Let <code>p = 0.2</code> be the probability of success and <code>q = 1-p = 0.8</code> the probability of failure.
    <ul>
      <li>The probability you will succeed at your 5th attempt after 4 failures is
      <br><b>P(X=5) = q<sup>4</sup> &middot; p = 0.8<sup>4</sup> &middot; 0.2 = 0.082</b>
      </li>
      <li>The probability you will succeed in 7 or less attempts is 1 minus the probability of failing 7 times.
      <br><b>P(X<=7) = 1 - q<sup>7</sup> = 1 - 0.8<sup>7</sup> = 0.79</b>
      </li>
      <li>The expected number of attempts you need to succeed is the expectation of the geometric distribution 
      <br><b>E(X) = 1 / p = 1 / 0.2 = 5</b>
      </li>
      <li>the variance of the expected number of attempts you need to succeed is found with the variance of a geometric distribution
      <br><b>Var(X) = q / p<sup>2</sup> = 0.8 / 0.2<sup>2</sup> = 20</b>
      </li>
    </ul>
- question: Given 6 questions where each question has 4 possible answers, what is the probability of answering 5 questions correctly?
  answer: >
    For this case we can use the formula of the binomial distribution 
    <b>P(X = r) = <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> &nbsp; p<sup>r</sup> &nbsp; q<sup>n - r</sup></b>. 
    Indeed we have the following conditions, that are typical for a binomial distribution&colon;
    <ul>
    <li>a limited number of trials (5)</li>
    <li>the probability of answering correctly a question is independent of the other questions</li>
    <li>each answer can either be correct or wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>In our case we have <code>r = 5</code> number of answers correct, <code>p = 0.25</code> probability of answering correctly a question,
    <code>q = 0.75</code> probability of answering wrongly a question, <code>n = 6</code> total number of questions.

- question: >
    Suppose that you live in a town where in average it can rain twice a week. What is the probability that next week
    it will not rain?
  answer: >
    You know that in this town it rains twice a week. Let <code>X</code> be the distribution of the number of times
    it rains. Since we have the scenario with a set of events happening in a certain interval (in a week it can rain twice) 
    and we know the mean values of times it rains in a week, we can say that <code>X</code> follows a <b>Poisson distribution</b>: 
    <br> <code>X ~ Po(&lambda;)</code> with <code>&lambda; = 2</code> (number of times it rains in a week).
    <br>To calculate the probability that next week it will not rain, we can use the formula of the Poisson distribution:
    <br><b>
    P(X = r) =
    <div class="frac">
    <span>e<sup>-&lambda;</sup> &lambda;<sup>r</sup></span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">r!</span>
    </div></b>. 
    <br>In our case we have <code>&lambda; = 2</code> and <code>r = 0</code> (0 rains in a week). It follows that the
    probability that it will not rain next week is
    <br>
    <b>

- question: >
    Suppose that you have a restaurant with a kitchen where, in average, the oven can break once a year and the fridge
    can break twice a year. What is the probability that nothing will break in the kitchen next year?
  answer: >
    Let <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> be the distributions of the number of malfunctions of the oven and the fridge. 
    Because we know the number of malfunctions in a certain time interval (one year), it follows that <code>X</code> and 
    <code>Y</code> follow a Poisson distribution. Thus we can write <code>X ~ Po(1)</code> and <code>Y ~ Po(2)</code>.
    <br><br>
    To find the probability that nothing breaks in the kitchen next year we need to find <code>P(X + Y) = 0</code>. 
    Because <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are indipendent distributions, we can sum the distributions as follows
    <br><code>X + Y ~ Po(3)</code>. 
    <br><br>
    <b>P(X + Y = 0) =
    <div class="frac">

  question: What is Numpy?
  answer: >
    <b>Numpy</b> is a Python library for numerical computation. Numpy uses libraries written in C and Fortran and this make it 
    very efficient to work with arrays and matrices. 
    <br><br>

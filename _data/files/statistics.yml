  h3: Types of data
  question: What are the three main types of data you can encounter in data science?
  answer: >
    The three main types of data are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>numerical data</b>: the data represents some kind of quantitative value that you can measure. It could be a temperature or a weight. 
    Numerical data can be divided into 
    <ul>
      <li><i>discrete data</i>: it is integer based and can take a limited set of values, for example like the amount of money you have on your account.</li> 
      <li><i>continuous data</i>: it has an infinite number of possible values like the weight of a person, which can be 60 Kg or 60.345 Kg or 60.345678 Kg. In this
      example you can take the weight with as many decimals as you like.</li> 
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>categorical data:</b> it is data that can have numerical values but those numbers have no intrinsic mathematical meaning. Some examples are gender, race, religion. 
    You can map values to numbers, like say male is 0 and female is 1. But those numbers have no mathematical meaning, i.e. the male value has no
    numerical relationship with the female value.</li>
    <li><b>ordinal data:</b> this is a mixture of numerical and categorical data. More specifically, it is categorical data with mathematical
    meaning. For example the hotel rating stars from 1 to 5 have a numerical meaning: a five star hotel
    is better than a two star hotel.</li>

- question: What is a random variable? Can you make an example?
  answer: > 
    A <b>random variable</b> is a variable that associates a numerical value with each possible outcome of a random phenomenon. 
    Each numerical value is linked to a specific probability according to a probability distribution
    <br><br>
    A classic <b>example of random variable</b> is the outcome of rolling a six-sided dice. In this case, the random variable
    represents the possible results that can result from rolling the dice. Let <code>X</code> be the random variable
    denoting the outcome of the dice. The random variable <code>X</code> can take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with each value
    having an equal probability of 1/6. 

- question: What is the difference between discrete and continuous random variables? Can you make a couple of examples of both?
  answer: >
    <b>Discrete random variables</b> have a finite number of possible 
    outcomes. An example of discrete random variables is the result of tossing a coin. 
    There are two possible outcomes (head or tail).   
    <br><br>
    <b>Continuous random variables</b> have a non-finite number of possible outcomes. In other words a continuous random
    variable can assume any value in an interval. An example of continuous random variable
    is the temperature in a room. The temperature can take any value within a range.
  - question: What is the difference between primary and secondary data?
    answer: >
      <b>Primary data</b> is collected first-hand for a specific research purpose (surveys, experiments, interviews).  
      <b>Secondary data</b> is collected by someone else, often for a different purpose (census reports, research articles, company databases).  
      Primary data ensures relevance and accuracy but is time-consuming and expensive. Secondary data is cost-effective and faster but may not perfectly fit your needs.

  - question: Explain structured vs unstructured data with examples.
    answer: >
      <b>Structured data</b> is highly organized in rows and columns; easy to store and analyze. Examples: SQL databases, Excel spreadsheets with employee data.  
      <b>Unstructured data</b> has no predefined format; difficult to analyze using traditional tools. Examples: emails, videos, social media posts, images.  
      Modern analytics often deals with unstructured data, requiring NLP, computer vision, and AI for insights.

  - question: What is multivariate data, and how is it different from univariate data?
    answer: >
      <b>Univariate data</b> measures only one variable. Example: height of students. Analysis focuses on mean, median, mode.  
      <b>Multivariate data</b> measures two or more variables to analyze relationships. Example: height, weight, and age of students.  
      Multivariate data enables advanced analysis like correlation, regression, and predictive modeling.
- question: Explain nominal data with an example.
    answer: >
      <b>Nominal data</b> is categorical data without any natural order. Examples:
      <ul>
      <li>Blood type: A, B, AB, O</li>
      <li>Hair color: Black, Brown, Blonde</li>
      </ul>
      Operations like addition or averaging don’t make sense. It is used for categorization, labeling, or grouping. In statistics, you can count frequencies, modes, or apply chi-square tests.

  - question: Explain ordinal data with an example.
    answer: >
      <b>Ordinal data</b> represents categories with a meaningful order, but intervals between categories aren’t uniform. Examples:
      <ul>
      <li>Customer satisfaction: Poor, Average, Good, Excellent</li>
      <li>Education level: High school, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD</li>
      </ul>
      You can say “Good > Average,” but cannot quantify the difference. Ordinal data is used in surveys, rating systems, and social research to understand ranking preferences.

- h3: Averages
  question: What is the meaning of average of the data?
  answer: You can think of the average as the center of the data.

  question: There are three different sorts of average&#58; mean, median, mode. How do they differ?
  answer: >    
    <b>Mean</b> (&mu;) = <div class="frac">
          <span>sum all items</span>
          <span class="symbol">/</span>
          <span class="bottom">number of items</span>
          </div>
    <br><br><b>Median</b> =  value in the middle when the values are sorted. When the number of items is even there is no a single middle
    value and the mean of the two middle numbers is taken instead.
    <br><br><b>Mode</b> = most frequent value in a dataset
    <br><br>
    For example given 1,3,4,4,2006 we have 
    <br>Mean = (1+3+4+4+2006) / 5
    <br>Median = 4
    <br>Mode = 4
    <br><br>
    For example given 1,3,4,5,6,8  we have 6 numbers. The median is given by the mean of the two middle values i.e. (4+5)/2


- question: When is the mean more useful and when the median is more useful?
  answer: >
    The <b>mean</b> is more useful when there are no outliers. Indeed the mean is more affected
    by outliers than the median. The mean tends to move in the directions of the outliers.
    <br><br>The <b>median</b> is more useful when there are outliers.
    <br><br>In other words, the mean 
    is more representative when the data distribution is normal while the median is more representative when 
    the data distribution is skewed.

- question: >
    What does it mean when the median and the mean have the same value or different values?
  answer: >
    If the distribution is a normal distribution then the mean and variance are equals.
    However, when the mean and variance are equal, this does not mean the distribution is normal.    
    <br><br>If mean > median, the distribution is skewed to the right, i.e. the tail is on the right.
    <br><br>If mean < median, the distribution is skewed to the left, i.e. the tail is on the left.
  image: mean_median_skewed.png

- question: Can you use the mean/median with categorical data?
  answer:  >
    No, it is not possible to use the mean/median with categorical data. Mean/median can be used only
    with numerical data. The average that you can use with categorical data is the mode.

- question: When is the mode useful as an average quantity? 
  answer: >
    The <b>mode</b> is the most frequent value in a dataset. The mode is useful as an average quantity when
    <ul>
    <li>the data is <i>categorical</i>. Indeed in this case the mode is the only average that can be used since the mean and median
    are used with numerical data.</li>
    <li>the data is <i>numerical or categorical</i> and there are two or more <i>clusters</i>. In that case it is more representive to take
    the node of each cluster. 
    <br><br>For example if you have the numbers <code>(2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 40, 40, 41, 41, 41, 42, 42)</code>, 
    we have two clusters. The more representative average values are then the modes 3 (mode of first cluster) and 41 (mode of second cluster).</li>
    </ul>
- h3: Variability and spread
  question: >
    What quantities can you use to measure variability and spread?
  answer: >
    You can use the following quantities: range, interquartile range, 
    variance and standard deviation.

- question: What is the range?
  answer: >
    The <b>range</b> is given by the difference between the largest and the smallest values in a dataset.
    The range is one of the ways of measuring how much a dataset is spread out.

- question: What are some advantages / disadvantages of the range?
  answer: >
    The <b>range</b> has the <i>advantage</i> that is pretty simple and thus easy to understand.
    <br><br>
    The <i>disadvantages</i> of the range are that it does not provide information about the data within the range
    and it is heavily affected by outliers. Indeed outliers are always at the border of the dataset. 

- question: What is the interquartile range?
  answer: >
    The <b>interquartile range (IQR)</b> is another way of measung how spread a data is. The idea is to provide a value
    that is less affected by outliers than it is the range. In simple terms the interquartile range can be thought of
    as a mini range around the center of the data.
    <br><br>
    The <b>interquartile range</b> can be found as follows:
    <ol>
    <li>sort the data.</li>
    <li>Find 3 values <code>Q1, Q2, Q3</code> that split your dataset into four equal parts. <code>Q1, Q2, Q3</code> are called <i>quartiles</i>.</li> 
    <li>The interquartile range is then given by <code>IQR = Q3 - Q1</code>. 
    <br><code>Q3</code> is called <i>upper quartile</i>, 
    <code>Q1</code> is called <i>lower quartile</i>.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    Notice that we take the quartiles around the center of the data. In this way outliers are excluded automatically from the computation
    of IQR.
- question: >
    When you compute the interquartile range, you have to find the so-called quartiles, points that divide the dataset 
    into four equal parts. The middle quartile is equal to a certain type of average. What average is that?
  answer: The <b>middle quartile</b> is equal to the median.

- question: What is the variance? What is its main disadvantage?
  answer: > 
    The <b>variance</b> is a way of measuring how the data is spread. The variance is defined as the average of the 
    squared distance of all points from the mean.
    <br>
    <b> Variance&nbsp; = &nbsp;<div class="frac">
          <span>&Sigma; (x - &mu;)<sup>2</sup></span>
          <span class="symbol">/</span>
          <span class="bottom">n</span>
          </div>
          &nbsp; = &nbsp; <div class="frac">
          <span>&Sigma; x<sup>2</sup></span>
          <span class="symbol">/</span>
          <span class="bottom">n</span>
          </div>&nbsp; - &nbsp; &mu;<sup>2</sup>
        </b>

    <br>where  &mu; = mean,    n = number of points
    <br><br>The main <i>disadvantage</i> of the variance is that it describes the data spread using squared distances,
     and this is less intuitive.
- question: What is the standard deviation?
  answer: >
    The <b>standard deviation</b> &rho; describes how spread the data is. It is actually the squared value of the <i>variance</i>.
    In this way the main weak point of the variance (the fact of using squared distances) is compensated.
    <br><br>
    &rho; = <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">
            &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-size:17px">variance</span>
            </span> 

    <br><br>A <u>small</u> standard deviation means that most of the points are close to the mean value. 
    A <u>high</u> standard deviation means the points are spread out and far away from the mean. 

- question: What is the minimum value of the standard deviation?
  answer: The smallest value of the standard deviation is 0. This happens when all data points are equal.

- question: What are standard scores? What is the main idea behind?
  answer: >
    <b>Standard scores</b> (denoted by z) are numerical quantities that allow you to compare data distributions with different
    means and variances. In mathematical terms we have
    <br>
    <b> z &nbsp; = &nbsp;<div class="frac">
          <span>x - &mu;</span>
          <span class="symbol">/</span>
          <span class="bottom">&rho;</span>
          </div>
    </b>
    <br> where &mu; = mean, &rho; = standard deviation.
    <br><br>
    The <b>main idea</b> behind standard scores is that the data distributions to compare are transformed into a new theoretical data 
    distribution with &mu; = 0 and &rho; = 1. This makes the comparison possible.


- h3: Probabilities
  question: >
    What is the definition of probability of occurence of event A, that is indicated by P(A)? 
    What are the maximum and minimum values of P(A)?
  answer: >
    The <b>probability</b> of occurence of event A is indicated by P(A) and is given by the number of ways that event A can happen divided by
    the number of all possible outcomes.
    <br><br>For example when you toss a coin, the probability of getting head is given by the number of ways you can get
    head (1 actually) divided by all possible outcomes (possible outcomes are 2: hear or tail), i.e. the probability of
    getting head is equal to 1 / 2.
    <br><br>In mathematical terms we have 
    <br><b>P(A) = num cases for event A / num all cases</b>
    <br><br>
    P(A) is a value between 0 (event not happening) and 1 (event happening for sure).

- question: What is the meaning of the complementary event of A, that is indicated by A’?
  answer: >
    P(A’) is the <b>complementary event</b> of A, i.e. it is the event that event A does not happen. 
    The complementary event is given by 
    <br><b>P(A') = 1-P(A)</b>

- question: What does it mean two events are mutually exclusive or disjoint? 
  answer: > 
    Two events are <b>mutually exclusive</b> or disjoint when only one of the two events can occur.

- question: What happens when two events intersect?
  answer: When two events intersect, they can occur simultaneously.

- question: What is the meaning of the probability P(A &cup; B)? What is the formula for the probability P(A &cup; B)? 
  answer: >
    <b>P(A &cup; B)</b> is the probability that either event A or event B happens. 
    <br><br>
    In mathematical terms we have<br>
    P(A &cup; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A &cap; B)
    <br><br>
    Notice that it is necessary to remove P(A &cap; B) because otherwise some probabilities would be counted twice.


- question: > 
    If  events A and B are disjoint, what is the formula for the probability 
    P(A &cup; B)?
  answer: >
    Since events A and B are <i>disjoint</i>, we have that P(A &cap; B) = 0. As a result<br> 
    <b>P(A &cup; B) = P(A) + P(B)</b>

- question: When are events A and B exhaustive?
  answer: >
    Events A and B are <b>exhaustive</b> when P(A &cup; B) = 1.  

- question: What does it mean that two events are independent?
  answer: >
    Two <b>independent events</b> are two events that do not affect each other. If one event occurs, 
    the probability of the other occuring remains exactly the same. 
    <br><br>
    When events A and B are independent, the conditional probability of A happening given that B has already happened is
    equal to the probability of A happening. We can write 
    <br><b>P(A|B) = P(A)</b>
- question: >
    If events A and B are independent, what is the probability of both events happen?
  answer: >
    Since events A and B are independent, we can write <b>P(A|B) = P(A)</b>.<br>If we also recall that <b>P(A|B) =  P(A &cap; B) / P(B)</b> 
    we can then write <br>  
    <b>P(A &cap; B) = P(A) x P(B)</b>

- question: >
    What diagram is particularly useful for visualizing probabilities? Can you use it
    to visualize P(A), P(A'), P(A &cup; B), P(A &cap; B)? 
  answer: >
    The <b>Venn diagram</b> is very useful for visualizing probabilities. The Venn diagram is
    a diagram where the space of all possible outcomes is represented by a rectangle and events are 
    represented by circles. <br><br>
    In the following image you can see the following probabilities represented with the Venn diagram:
    <ul>
    <li>P(A) = probability of event A happening.</li>
    <li>P(A') = probability of event A' happening, i.e. probability of event A <u>not</u> happening.</li>
    <li>P(A &cup; B) = probability of event A <u>or</u> event B happening.</li>
    <li>P(A &cap; B) = probability of events A <u>and</u> B happening.</li>
    </ul>
  image: venn_diagrams.png 

- question: What is the meaning of conditional probability P(A|B)? What is its formula?
  answer: >
    The <b>conditional probability P(A|B)</b> is the probability that event A happens
    given that event B has already happened. P(A|B) can be calculated as follows
    <br><br>
    <b>P(A|B) = <div class="frac">
    <span>P(A &cap; B)</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">P(B)</span>
    </div></b>

- question: > 
    What diagram is particularly useful for visualizing conditional probabilities? Can you use
    this diagram to visualize the conditional probability P(A|B)?
  answer: >
    <b>Conditional probabilities</b> can be well visualized with <b>probability trees</b>, while Venn diagram are not
    so useful for conditional probabilities. 
    <br><br>In the picture below you can see an example of probability tree. It is a tree structure with the leaves A, A', B, B' that are
    grouped as sets of exaustive events. More specifically, B and B' are exhaustive as well as A and A'. The first set of branches shows
    the probabilities P(B) and P(B'). The second set of branches shows the probabilities of P(A), P(A') given that the probabilities
    of the first set of branches have happened. Notice that the probabilites of each set of branches sums to 1.
  image: conditional_tree.png

- question: When is the Venn diagram useful and when is the probability tree useful?
  answer: >
    The <b>Venn diagram</b> is useful when you want to show intersecting and mutually exclusive events.
    <br><br>
    The <b>probability tree</b> is useful when you want to show conditional probabilities.

- question: What is the Law of Total Probability?
  answer: >
    The <b>Law of Total Probability</b> allows you to find the probability of an event by using conditional probabilities. The key idea
    is that we find the probability of an event by adding together the probabilities of all different ways that event can happen.
    In the example below P(B) can happen in two ways, either with event A or without event A. In mathematical terms we have
    <br><br>   
    <b>P(B) = P(B &cap; A) + P(B &cap; A’) = 
    P(A) P(B|A) + P(A’) P(B|A’)</b>

- question: What is the Bayes' Theorem? Can you find its formula?
  answer: >
    The <b>Bayes' Theorem</b> allows you to find reverse conditional probabilites. In other words, given the probabilities
    P(B|A) and P(B|A'), the Bayes' Theorem allows you to find the reverse conditional probability P(A|B).
    <br><br>The formula for the Bayes' Theorem is
    <br><br> 
    <b>P(A|B) = 
    <div class="frac">
    <span>P(A &cap; B)</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">P(B)</span>
    </div>
    =<br>
    <div class="frac">
    <span>P(A) * P(B|A)</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">P(B  &cap; A) + P(B &cap; A')</span>
    </div>
    =<br>
    <div class="frac">
    <span>P(A) * P(B|A)</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A') * P(B|A')</span>
    </div>
    </b>
    <br><br>Notice that the denominator is the law of total probability.
    
- question: if two events are independent, can they be mutually exclusive?
  answer: >
    If two events A and B are independent, both events can happen so they <u>cannot</u> be mutually exclusive. Indeed
    A and B would be mutually exclusive when only one of the events could happen.

- h3: Discrete probability distributions
  question: What is a probability distribution? 
  answer: >
    A <b>probability distribution</b> is a plot that displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes 
    of a random variable.
  
- question: What is the symbol for a random variable and the symbol for the possible values it can take?
  answer: >
    A <b>random variable</b> is represented by a capital letter like X or Y. 
    <br><br>
    The <b>possible values</b> that the random variable can take are represented by a lowercase letter
    like x or y.

- question: What is the expectation of a probability distribution?
  answer: >
    The <b>expectation E(X)</b> (also indicated by <b>&mu;</b>) of a probability distribution X is basically the average value of the
    probability distribution. In other words, the expectation is the expected long-term average value.  It is defined as
    <br><br>
    <b>E(X) = &Sigma; x * P(X = x)</b>
    <br><br>
    For example given x = 1,2,3 and P(x) = 0.2, 0.5, 0.3 we have that E(X) equals 
    1*0.2 + 2*0.5 + 3*0.3 = 2.1

- question: What are the formulas for the variance and standard deviation of a probability distribution?
  answer: >
    The <b>variance</b> of a probability distribution is defined as:
    <br>
    <b>
    Var(X) = E(X - &mu;)<sup>2</sup> = &Sigma; (x - &mu;)<sup>2</sup> P(X=x)
    </b>
    <br><br>
    The <b>standard deviation</b> of a probability distribution is defined as the root square of the variance.
    <br>
    <b>
    &rho; = <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">
            &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-size:17px">Var(X)</span>
            </span>
    </b>
- question: > 
    Let's suppose you know the expectation and variance of a probability distribution X, write the formulas
    of expectation and variance of the distribution <code>Y = aX + b</code>.
  answer: >
    <code>Y = aX + b</code> means that <code>Y</code> is obtained from a linear transformation of <code>X</code>. 
    With linear transformations the values are changed but the probabilities remain the same. This means that in 
    the given example <code>Y</code> has different values from <code>X</code> but the same probabilities. 
    As a result we can use the following shortcuts
    to compute <code>E(Y)</code> from <code>E(X)</code> and <code>Var(Y)</code> from <code>Var(X)</code>. 
    <br><br>
    <b>E(Y) = E(aX + b) = a E(x) + b</b>
    <br>
    <b>Var(Y) = Var(aX+b) = a<sup>2</sup> Var(X)</b>

- question: >
    Given a probability distribution X, what are the expectation and variance of <code>n</code> independent 
    observations (X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...X<sub>n</sub>) that follow the same distribution?
  answer:
    Given <code>n</code> independent observations (X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...X<sub>n</sub>) we have
    <br><br>
    <b>
    E(X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...X<sub>n</sub>) = n X(n)
    <br><br>
    Var(X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...X<sub>n</sub>) = n Var(x)
    </b>

- question: >
    Given two independent probability distributions P(X) and P(Y) with expectations E(X) and E(Y) 
    and variances Var(X) and Var(Y) respectively, what are the expectations and variances of the 
    probability distributions P(X + Y) and P(X - Y)? 
  answer: >
    Because P(X) and P(Y) are <u>independent</u> probability distributions, we can write
    <br><br><b>E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)
    <br><br>Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)
    <br><br>E(X - Y) = E(X) - E(Y)
    <br><br>Var(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)
    </b>
    <br>Notice that even if we subtract X and Y, the variance increases. 

- h3: Permutations and combinations
  question: >
    Given <code>n</code> objects, in how many ways can you arrange them in a line? In how many ways can you arrange
    them in a circle?
  answer: >
    Given <code>n</code> objects, you can arrange them 
    <br><br><b>n!</b> times in a line
    <br><br><b>(n-1)!</b> times in a circle
  
- question: >
    Given <code>n</code> objects where <code>k</code> of them are of a type and <code>j</code> of them of another type, 
    in how many ways can you arrange them by type?
  answer: >
    Given <code>n</code> objects, where <code>k</code> are of a type and <code>j</code> are of another type, the total
    numbers of ways the objects can be arranged by type is

    In how many ways can you choose <code>k</code> items out of <code>n</code> items when the order matters? In how many ways
    can you choose <code>k</code> items when the order <u>does not</u> matter? How is it called the number of ways when the order counts
    and does not count? 
  answer: >
    Given <code>n</code> objects, you can pick <code>k</code> items in a fixed order in a number of ways that is indicated by
    <b><sup>n</sup>P<sub>k</sub></b> and is defined as

    Given <code>n</code> objects, you can pick <code>k</code> items without caring of the order in a number of ways that is

    <b><sup>n</sup>P<sub>k</sub></b> is the number of <b>permutations</b> (for which the order matters). 
    <b><sup>n</sup>C<sub>k</sub></b> is the number of <b>combinations</b> (for which the order does <u>not</u> matter).

- question: >
    Given <code>n</code> items, when you pick <code>k</code> items, what is the difference 
    between permutations and combinations?
  answer: >
    <b>Permutations</b> are about choosing <code>k</code> items in a particular order. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Combinations</b> are about choosing <code>k</code> items without caring of the order.
    <br><br>
    For example if you pick an apple and then a banana or if you pick a banana and then an apple, we have
    two different permutations (order matters) but only one combination (order does not matter).

- question: Can it happen that the number of permutations is less than the number of combinations?
  answer: >
    No, it can never happen that the number of permutations is less than the number of combinations. This is due to the 
    fact that the order does matter for permutations. For example if we have an apple and a banana to pick,
    we have one possible combination but two possible permutations because picking first the banana is
    a different permutation from picking first the apple. On the contrary it is the same combination if we
    pick first the banana or the apple since the order does not matter for combinations.

  question: >
    If the probability of success of an event is <code>p</code> and its probability of failure is
    <code>q = 1 - p</code>, what is the formula of the probability that the event succeeds after <code>n</code> attempts? 
    What is the name of this formula?
  answer: >
    Let <code>p</code> be the probability of success and <code>q = 1 - p</code> the probability of failure. The probability
    of success after <code>n</code> attempts is
    <br><br>
    <b>P(X = n) = q<sup>n-1</sup> p</b>
    <br><br>
    This formula is called the <b>geometric distribution</b>.    

- question: >
    What real-world scenarios are described by a geometric distribution? What is its formula and distribution? 
    What is the mode of any geometric distribution?
  answer: >
    The scenarios that are described by a <b>geometric distribution</b> are those where
    <ul>
    <li>you have a set of independent trials</li>
    <li>each trial can either succeed or fail. The probability of success at each trial is the same</li>
    <li>you are interested in the probability of succeeding after <code>n</code> trials.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Let <code>X</code> be the number of trials needed to get a successful outcome. The probability
    of <code>X</code> being a certain value <code>r</code> is
    <br><b>P(X = r) = q<sup>r-1</sup> p</b>
    <br><br>
    The probability distribution of a geometric distribution is given by the image below. 
    <br><br>The mode of any geometric distribution is 1 because <code>P(X=r)</code> has the maximum value at <code>r</code>=1 
    and decreases as <code>r</code> increases.

- question: >
    Given a geometric distribution <code>X</code>, what is the probability that more than <code>r</code> trials
    are needed to get the first successful outcome? What is the probability that <code>r</code> or less trials are needed to get
    the first succesful outcome? The probability of success of each trial is denoted by <code>p</code>.
  answer: >
    In order to need more than <code>r</code> trials to succeed, we must fail at least <code>r</code> times. We can then write
    <br>
    <b>P(X > r) = (1 - p)<sup>r</sup></b>
    <br><br>
    The probability of needing <code>r</code> or less trials to succeed is given by

    where we have <code>n</code> trials, probabilities of success <code>p</code> and insuccess <code>q</code> of each trial,  
    and <code>r</code> successes?
  answer: >
    A <b>binomial distribution</b> describes the following cases
    <ul>
      <li>we have a number of independent trials</li>
      <li>each trial can either succeed or fail. The probability of success at each trial is the same</li>

- question: What scenarios are covered by a Poisson distribution?
  answer: >
    The <b>Poisson distribution</b> covers scenarios where&colon;
    <ol>
      <li>we have a set of independent events occurring at random in a given interval of space or time.</li>
      <li>we know the mean number of occurrences in that interval. This mean is represented by the symbol <code>&lambda;</code> (lambda).</li>

- question: >
    How to indicate that the variable <code>X</code> follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of occurencies 
    of <code>&lambda;</code>? What is the formula for finding the probability that there are <code>r</code> occurencies
    in a specific interval?
  answer: >
    To indicate that <code>X</code> follows a <b>Poisson distribution</b> with a mean of occurencies of <code>&lambda;</code> 
    we can write 
    <br>
    <b>
    <code>X ~ Po(&lambda;)</code>
    </b>
    <br><br>
    The formula for finding the probability of having <code>r</code> occurencies in a specific interval is

- question: What are the expectation and variance for the Poisson distribution?
  answer: >
    Given a <b>Poisson distribution</b> <code>X ~ Po(&lambda;)</code>, 
    the expectation E(X) and variance Var(X) are
    <br>
    <b>E(X) = Var(X) = &lambda;</b> 

- question: >
    What is the main difference between the Poisson distribution and the binomial 
    and geometric distributions?
  answer: >
    The biggest difference between the <b>Poisson distribution</b> and the 
    binomial and geometric distributions is that the Poisson distribution
    does not involve a series of independent trials. The Poisson distribution
    describes the number of occurencies in a particular time or space interval.
    By contrast binomial and geometric distributions do involve
    a set of independent trials. 

- question: >
    Given two independent Poisson distributions <code>X ~ Po(&lambda;<sub>x</sub>)</code> and 
    <code>Y ~ Po(&lambda;<sub>y</sub>)</code>, what is the distribution of <code>X+Y</code>?
  answer: >
    If two distributions <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are independent, then
    <br><b>P(X + Y) = P(X) + P(Y)</b> 
    <br><b>E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)</b>.
    <br>It follows that 
    <br><b>X + Y ~ Po(&lambda;<sub>x</sub> + &lambda;<sub>y</sub>)</b>.
    <br>In other words, if <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are Poisson distributions, so
    is <code>X + Y</code> a Poisson distribution.


- question: What types of discrete probability distributions are there?
  answer: >
     There are the Bernoulli distribution, the Binomial distribution and
     the Poisson distribution.
     <br><br>
     The <b>Bernoulli distribution</b> is a random experiment that has 2 possible
     outcomes with probability p and q, where p+q = 1
     <br><br>
     The <b>Binomial distribution</b> is a sequence of repeated Bernoulli trials
     performed indipendently. 
     <br>
     n = number of items, k = num items I pickup
     <br> All possible combinations are n! / ( (n-k)! * k! )
     <br><br>
     The <b>Poisson distribution</b> is a limiting version of the Binomial distribution
     where the number of trials n gets really large but the probability of success p
     gets smaller at the same time. In other words if you have a Binomial distribution
     where you let n tends to infinite and p tends to zero such that np = &lambda;, then
     that distribution approaches a Poisson distribution with parameter &lambda;.

- h3: Continuous probability distributions
  question: >
    When you have measured data, is this usually discrete or continuous data?
    When you have data that you can count, is this discrete or continuous data?
  answer: >
    <b>Measured data</b> is <b>continuous data</b> because in that case you have an infinite
    number of values you can measure depending on the accuracy of the instrument of measure.
    For example a distance can be 4.5mm or 4.56mm, but there are potentially an infinite number
    of decimal numbers that are given by the accuracy of the measurement.
    <br><br>
    Data that you can count is discrete data since it has a finite number of values.

- question: >
    What is the difference between what we want to find for discrete and continuous 
    probability distributions?
  answer: >
    For <b>discrete probabilitiy distributions</b> we are interested in finding the
    probability of getting a particular value.

    <br><br>For <b>continuous probabilitiy distributions</b> we are interested in the
    probability of getting a range of values. The size of the range is given
    by the degree of accuracy. Indeed for continuous data you cannot get the probability
    of a specific value because that value can have an infinite number of decimals.

- question: What is a probability density function? How to find the probabilities?
  answer: >
    A <b>probability density function</b> describes the probability distribution of a continuous
    random variable. 
    <br><br>
    The probabilities are given by the area under the curve.


- h3: Normal distribution
  question: What is the normal distribution? What parameters do define the normal distribution?
  answer: >
    The <b>normal distribution</b> is a density distribution where the data is distributed 
    around a central value in the form of a bell-shaped curve. Random variables 
    typically have a normal distribution.
    <br><br>
    The normal distribution is defined by the <b>mean &mu;</b> and the <b>standard deviation &sigma;<sup>2</sup></b>. 
    &mu; defines the center of the curve and &sigma;<sup>2</sup> defines the spread of the data. 
    <br><br>In mathematical terms the normal distribution is indicated as <b>X ~ N(&mu;,&sigma;<sup>2</sup>)</b>.
    <br><br>
    A normal distribution looks like the following image. In this example we have <code>&mu; = 4</code> and <code>&sigma; = 1</code>.
  image: normal_distribution.png

- question: Why is the normal distribution called <i>normal</i>?
  answer: >
    The <b>normal distribution</b> is called <i>normal</i> because it is seen as 
    the distribution that you would expect for many continuous data in real life.
    In practice many distributions of continuous data resemble the normal distribution.

- question: What is the Central Limit Theorem? Why is it important?
  answer: >
    The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution 
    of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger.
    <br><br>
    The Central Limit Theorem is important because under certain conditions you can 
    approximate a non-normal distribution with a normal distribution.

- question: What is the difference between a parametric and a non-parametric test?
  answer:
    <p>Parametric tests are statistical tests that make assumptions about the distribution of the data. For example, a t-test assumes that the data is normally distributed. Non-parametric tests do not make assumptions about the distribution of the data.
    Parametric tests are generally more powerful than non-parametric tests, but they are only valid if the data meets the assumptions of the test. Non-parametric tests are less powerful than parametric tests, but they can be used on any type of data, regardless of the distribution.
    It is important to choose the right type of test for your data.</p>

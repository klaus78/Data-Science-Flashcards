  question: What is Deep Learning? Why is it called deep?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep Learning</b> is a subdomain of machine learning that makes use of artificial
    neural networks to learn from complex data structures like images and sounds. 
    <br><br>
    Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing structures that try to emulate the 
    human brain. ANN basic blocks are called neurons. A neuron can be thought of as
    a function that has a number of weighted inputs and computes an output. These neurons are 
    organized in layers and a simple form of ANN has an input layout, a middle layer and
    an output layer. All layers between the input layer and the output layer are called
    <i>hidden layers</i>. An ANN with one of two hidden layers is called a 
    <i>shallow neural network</i>. 
    <br><br>Deep Learning neural networks have many hidden layers. The word <b>deep</b> refers
    to this fact.

- question: What are the differences between machine learning and deep learning?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep learning</b> is a subset of <b>machine learning</b>. Both machine learning
    and deep learning tries to create a mathematical model of a dataset. This mathematical
    model can then be used to make predictions on new input data. However these technologies
    differ in some points:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Techniques used</b>: machine learning can use several different techniques to create a mathematical model, 
    like regression, neural networks, nearest neighbors and decision trees.  By contrast, deep learning is
    based only on neural networks. These neural networks have a large number of hidden layers, which is what the 
    word <i>deep</i> refers to.</li>
    <li><b>quantity of data</b>: while machine learning algorithms can also work with small datasets, deep learning requires
    very large datasets.</li>
    <li><b>Feature selection</b>: in machine learning, the user selects the most important features or creates new ones 
    for the task at hand. By contrast, in deep learning the feature selection is done automatically by the algorithms during
    the training process.</li>
    </ul>

 

- question: What kind of neural networks works particularly well with image data?
  answer: >
    <b>Convolutional neural networks</b> are a kind of neural network that works
    particularly well with image data.
    <br><br>
    The basic idea behind convolutional neural networks is to 
    divide the input image into small fragments and apply a number of filters on 
    each fragment. Applying a filter is equivalent to searching for a pattern in the fragment.
    Each filter has a specific task, like searching for edges or for circles. 
    <br><br>
    In this way convolutional neural networks can better deal with images that are not very similar,
    for example because the images are rotated differently.

- question: What kind of neural network is particulary good at processing text data?
  answer: >
    A kind neural network that is particulary good at processing text data is 
    <b>recurrent neural networks</b>.
    <br><br>
    A recurrent neural network has an intern loop, that means the data is not processed all at once 
    but rather it is processed in different steps. In particular in the case of text, each word is 
    processed once at a time. This process is similar to the way humans read text.

- question: What is transfer learning? What are some typical use cases?
  answer: >
    <b>Transfer learning</b> is a technique in which a model, that was tried tried on a task,
    is applied to a different but related task. For example you have a model trained to
    recognize cars and you use that model to recognize trucks.
    <br><br>The obvious advantage of transfer learning is that you can reuse an existing model with
    minimal effort. 
    <br><br>Some typical use cases of transfer learning are
    <ul>
    <li>You do not have enough data to train a model from scratch. Starting with a pre-trained can allow you
    to train the model for your task.</li>
    <li>You do not have enough time to train a model from scratch. Because training models can take days or even
    weeks, using a pre-trained model is much more faster.</li>
    </ul>

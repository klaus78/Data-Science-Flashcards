  question: What is Deep Learning? Why it is called deep?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep Learning</b> is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex tasks. 
    These neural networks are composed of multiple layers (hence <b>"deep"</b>), and they are trained on large datasets to make 
    predictions or decisions. These deep NNs can lean from complex and unstructured data like texts, images or even sounds.

  question: What are the differences between machine learning and deep learning?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep learning</b> is a subset of <b>machine learning</b>. Both machine learning
    and deep learning try to create a mathematical model of a dataset. This mathematical
    model can then be used to make predictions on new input data.
    <br>
    However deep learning and machine learning differ in some points:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Techniques used</b>: machine learning can use several different techniques to create a mathematical model, 
    like regression, neural networks, nearest neighbors and decision trees.  By contrast, deep learning is
    based only on neural networks. These neural networks have a large number of hidden layers, which is what the 
    word <i>deep</i> refers to.</li>
    <li><b>Quantity of data</b>: while machine learning algorithms can also work with small datasets, deep learning requires
    very large datasets.</li>
    <li><b>Feature selection</b>: in machine learning, the user selects the most important features or creates new ones 
    for the task at hand. By contrast, in deep learning the feature selection is done automatically by the algorithms during
    the training process.</li>
    </ul>

- question: What is Deep Learning used for?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep learning</b> is used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, 
    autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems, and more.

- question: To what does the term <i>deep</i> refer in deep learning?
  answer: >
    <b>Deep learning</b> is a subset of machine learning methods that relies on artificial neural networks (ANNs) 
    with representation learning. The term <b>deep</b> specifically refers to the use of multiple hidden layers
    within the neural network architecture.
    These layers allow the network to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input data, resulting in more 
    complex and abstract representations. 
    
- question: What is a deepfake?
  answer: >
    A <b>deepfake</b> refers digital content, like videos or pictures, that are created using deep learning
    algorithms. These creations convey information or events that are either false or have never occured in reality.
    <br><br>
    Essentially, deepfakes manipulate media to present a distorted version of the truth.

- h3: Neural Networks
  question: What is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)?
  answer: >
    An <b>artificial neural network</b> is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It 
    consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers, typically an input layer, one or more hidden layers, 
    and an output layer.

- question: What are Neurons in a Neural Network?
  answer: >
    <b>Neurons (also called nodes)</b> in a neural network are basic computational units that receive inputs, perform a weighted sum 
    of those inputs, and apply an activation function to produce an output. They are the building blocks of the network.

- question: What is a Shallow Neural Network and Deep Neural Network?
  answer: > 
    A <b>shallow neural network</b> is a neural network which typically has only one or two hidden layers 
    (layers between the input layer and the output layer).
    <br><br>
    By contrast, <b>Deep neural networks</b> have multiple hidden layers. They are capable of learning complex representations, 
    whereas shallow networks are less capable of capturing intricate patterns.

- h3: Types of Neural Networks
  question: What are some types of neural networks? What are they used for?
  answer: > 
    Some types of neural networks are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b>: used for image and video analysis, object recognition, and computer 
    vision tasks.</li>
    <li><b>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</b>: ideal for sequence data, like natural language processing, time series 
    analysis, and speech recognition.</li>
    <li><b>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks</b>: a type of RNN that's effective at learning long-term dependencies in 
    sequences.</li>
    <li><b>Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks</b>: another variant of RNNs, useful for many of the same tasks as LSTMs but 
    with lower computational complexity.</li>
    <li><b>Autoencoders</b>: often employed for dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and data denoising. </li>
    <li><b>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</b>: used for generating new data samples, image-to-image translation, and 
    creating realistic images.</li>
    <li><b>Transformers</b>: ideal for natural language processing tasks, like machine translation, language understanding, 
    and text generation.</li>
    </ul>
    
- question: What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?
  answer: >
    <b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</b> are a type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data, such as 
    images and video. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn features from the input data.

- question: What is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)?
  answer: >
    <b>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</b> are neural networks with loops that allow information to be passed from one step 
    of the network to the next. They are commonly used for sequential data, like time series and natural language processing.

- question: What kind of neural networks works particularly well with image data?
  answer: >
    <b>Convolutional neural networks</b> are a kind of neural network that works
    particularly well with image data.
    <br>
    The basic idea behind convolutional neural networks is to 
    divide the input image into small fragments and apply a number of filters on 
    each fragment. Applying a filter is equivalent to searching for a pattern in the fragment.
    Each filter has a specific task, like searching for edges or for circles.
    <br>
    In this way convolutional neural networks can better deal with images that are not very similar,
    for example because the images are rotated differently.

- question: What kind of neural network is particulary good at processing text data?
  answer: >
    A kind neural network that is particulary good at processing text data is 
    <b>recurrent neural networks</b>.
    <br>
    A recurrent neural network has an intern loop, that means the data is not processed all at once 
    but rather is processed in different steps. In particular in the case of text, each word is 
    processed once at a time. This process is similar to the way humans read text.

- question: What is the self-attention technique that is used in deep learning?
  answer: >
    <b>Self-attention</b> is a powerful mechanism used in deep learning, particularly in natural language 
    processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. 
    Self-attention allows neural networks to capture contextual dependencies and relationships 
    within input sequences.
    <br><br>
    For each token, self-attention computes a weighted sum of all other tokens in the sequence, where the weights 
    reflect the relevance of each token to the current one. The attention mechanism learns to focus on relevant 
    tokens dynamically, rather than relying on fixed positional embeddings. 
    <br><br>
    Self-attention allows a model to consider 
    all positions in the input sequence when making predictions for a specific position.
    By constrast, traditional neural network models (like RNNs and CNNs) have fixed receptive fields, limiting their 
    ability to capture long-range dependencies. Self-attention overcomes this limitation.

- question: What is the transformer architecture?
  answer: >
    The <b>transformer architecture</b> is a neural network architecture introduced at Google
    in 2017. In general, a transformer is something that transforms one sequence into one another, like
    a translation from one language into another language.
    <br><br>
    Transformers consist of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input sequence and
    generates encodings which define what parts of the input sequence are related with each other.
    The decoder takes the generated encodings to generate the output sequence. Transformers use sequence-to-sequence
    learning in the sense that they take a sequence of input tokens and try to predict the next token in the output
    sequence. This is done by iterating through the encoding layers.
    <br><br>
    Transformers do not necessarily process data in order, rather run multiple sequences in parallel. 
    Transformers do use the so-called attention mechanism, that provides context to the tokens of the 
    input sequence, i.e. context information that gives a meaning to each token.

- question: What is the attention mechanism used by the transformer architecture?
  answer: 

- h3: Training and Optimization
  question: How are weights initialized in a neural network?
  answer: >
    There are several ways to initialize weights in a neural network. Here are some of the most common methods:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Initialize the weights to zero</b>: this makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every
    layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless.</li> 
      <li><b>Initializing all weights randomly</b>: the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close
        to 0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the
        most commonly used method</li>
    </ul> 

- question: What is an activation function?
  answer: >
    An <b>activation function</b> introduces non-linearity into a neural network. It determines whether a neuron should be 
    activated (output a non-zero value) or not. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), 
    Sigmoid, and Tanh.

- question: Explain different types of activation functions and its uses?
  answer: >
    <ul>
    <li><b>Sigmoid</b>: It converts the input into the value between 0 and 1 using the formula g(z) = 1/(1+e**(-z))
    <br>It is used in Binary classification and multilabel classification</li>
    <li><b>ReLU</b>: It converts the negitive input to 0 using the formula g(z) = max(0, z)
    <br>It is used in Regression when expected output is always positive and mostly used in hidden layers for better gradient flow.</li>
    <li><b>Linear</b>: It gives the output same as input using formula g(z) = z
    <br>It is used in output layers for regression models.</li>
    <li><b>Softmax</b>: It gives vector as output using the formula g(z) = e**zi/sum(e**z) ∀(zi ∈ z) where z = [z1, z2, z3...]
    <br>It is used in multiclassification</li>
    <li><b>Tanh</b>: It converts the input into the value between -1 and 1 using the formula g(z) = (e**x-e**-x)/e**x+e**-x)
    <br>It is used in hidden layers when the input data is centered around 0 to maintain the scale especially in RNN to handle sequential data.</li>
    </ul>

- question: What is the purpose of an activation function in a neural network?
  answer: >
    The <b>purpose of activation functions</b> is to add non-linearity to a neural network, allowing the network to model complex 
    relationships within the data. 
    Activation functions  Activation functions also determine the output of neurons, enabling the network to 
    make decisions and learn from a vast array of features.

- question: What is a cost function?
  answer: >
    A <b>cost function</b> (or also called loss function) is a mathematical measure that quantifies how well a neural network's predictions match 
    the actual target values. The goal in training a neural network is to minimize this function.
    <br>
    It is primarily used for two purposes:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Model Training</b>: During the training phase, it quantifies the disparity between the predictions of a machine learning 
    model and the true target values, guiding the adjustment of model parameters for better predictions.</li>
    <li><b>Evaluation</b>: After training, the cost function serves as an evaluation metric, measuring how well the model 
    generalizes to new data. Lower cost function values indicate better model performance.</li>
    </ul>

- question: What is batch normalization?
  answer: >
    <b>Batch normalization</b> is a technique for improving the performance and stability of neural networks. It involves 
    normalizing the outputs of each layer, i.e., transforming them to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps to 
    reduce the internal covariate shift problem, which is the change in the distribution of network activations due to 
    the change in network parameters during training.

- question: What is backpropagation?
  answer: >
    <b>Backpropagation</b> is a fundamental algorithm used to train neural networks. It involves iteratively adjusting the network's 
    weights and biases to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual target values.

- question: What is the purpose of dropout regularization in deep learning?
  answer: >
    <b>Dropout regularization</b> prevents overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of neurons during training,
    forcing the network to learn more robust features and reducing reliance on specific neurons.

- h3: Transfer Learning
  question: What is Transfer Learning? When should it be used?
  answer: >
    <b>Transfer learning</b> is a technique where a pre-trained neural network is adapted for a new, related task. This can 
    significantly reduce the amount of data and training time required for the new task.
    <br>
    The most important scenarios to consider using transfer learning are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Limited Data</b>: When you have a small dataset that is insufficient to train a deep model effectively, transfer learning 
    can provide a substantial boost in performance. </li>
    <li><b>Similar Tasks</b>: If your problem is closely related to a task for which a pre-trained model exists, transfer learning 
    is highly advantageous, as it leverages the knowledge from the related task. </li>
    <li><b>Resource Constraints</b>: When computational resources, including time and hardware, are limited, using pre-trained models 
    is efficient compared to training a model from scratch. </li>
    <li><b>Domain Adaptation</b>: When you need to work in a new domain but have access to data from a related domain, transfer 
    learning can be used to adapt the model from the related domain to the new one. </li>
    <li>You do not have enough data to train a model from scratch. Starting with a pre-trained can allow you
    to train the model for your task.</li>
    <li>You do not have enough time to train a model from scratch. Because training models can take days or even
    weeks, using a pre-trained model is much more faster.</li>
    </ul>

- question: Explain the concept of transfer learning in deep learning. Provide a real-world example.
  answer: >
    <b>Transfer learning in deep learning</b> is a technique where a pre-trained neural network, typically on a large dataset, is 
    used as a starting point to solve a different but related problem. The idea is to leverage the knowledge gained during 
    training on the initial task and adapt it to the new task, often with less training data and computation.
    <br><br>
    For example, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that has learned to recognize a wide range of 
    objects in images can be fine-tuned for a specific image classification task, like classifying different species of flowers.
    The pre-trained model already possesses features that are generally useful for recognizing edges, shapes, and textures, 
    making it easier to adapt to the new task with a smaller dataset.

- question: What is the vanishing gradient problem in deep learning, and how can it be mitigated?
  answer: >
    The <b>vanishing gradient problem</b> is a challenge in training deep neural networks, particularly in recurrent 
    neural networks (RNNs) and deep feedforward networks. It occurs when gradients become extremely small during 
    backpropagation, causing the network's weights to update very slowly or not at all. This can lead to slow convergence 
    and difficulty in training deep models.
    <br><br>
    To mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, several techniques can be used:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> replace activation functions like sigmoid with alternatives such as 
                ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which are less prone to vanishing gradients.</li>
      <li><strong>Weight Initialization:</strong> use appropriate weight initialization techniques like Xavier/Glorot 
                initialization to ensure that weights have reasonable initial values.</li>
      <li><strong>Batch Normalization:</strong> apply batch normalization to normalize the inputs at each layer, helping 
            gradients to flow more smoothly.</li>
      <li><strong>Gated Architectures:</strong> architectures like LSTMs and GRUs use gating mechanisms to control the flow of 
            information, reducing the vanishing gradient problem in sequential data models.</li>
      <li><strong>Gradient Clipping:</strong> clip gradients during training to prevent them from becoming excessively large 
          or small.</li>
    </ul>

- h3: Large Language Models (LLMs)
  question: What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?
  answer: >
    A <b>Large Language Model (LLM)</b> is a type of language model that can achieve advanced language understanding and generation.
    LLMs are highly efficient at capturing the complex entity relationships in the text at hand and can generate the text using the 
    semantic and syntactic of that particular language in which we wish to do so. They can perform tasks like text generation, 
    machine translation, summary writing, image generation from texts, machine coding, chat-bots, or Conversational AI.
    <br><br>
    LLMs are artificial neural networks, mainly transformers, that are trained on massive amount of data and take millions of parameters.
    As autoregressive language models, they work by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word. 

- question: How do Large Language Models (LLMs) work?
  answer:
    <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b> are a type of artificial intelligence model that is designed to understand and generate human language.
    LLMs represent words as long lists of numbers, known as <i>word vectors</i>. For example, the word “cat” might be represented as a list of 
    300 numbers.
    <br><br>
    Most LLMs are built on a neural network architecture known as the transformer. This architecture enables the model to identify relationships 
    between words in a sentence, irrespective of their position in the sequence.
    <br><br>
    LLMs are trained using a technique known as <i>transfer learning</i>, where a pre-trained model is adapted to a specific task. 
    They learn by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next word. This requires massive amounts of data and 
    computational resources.
    <br><br>
    Once trained, LLMs can generate text by taking a series of words as input and predicting the most likely next word, over and 
    over, until they’ve generated a full piece of text.

- question: What is pre-training and fine-tuning in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs)?
  answer: >
    <b>Pre-training</b> and <b>fine-tuning</b> are two key stages in the training of Large Language Models (LLMs):
    <ul>
      <li><b>Pre-training</b>: this is the initial stage involving the training of the model on a large and diverse 
      dataset that contains vast amounts of text. The model learns to predict the next
      word in a given sentence or sequence, developing a profound understanding of grammar, context and semantics.</li>
      <li><b>Fine-tuning</b>: after the pre-training phase on a general text dataset, the model is fine-tuned, or in
      simple words, trained to perform a specific task such as sentiment analysis, translation, text summarization and so on.
      Fine-tuning involves updating the weights of a pre-trained language model on a new task and dataset.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    The division of training into pre-training and fine-tuning is a form of transfer learning. The idea is that the model, having
    learned a broad understanding of language during pre-training, can then be fine-tuned on specific tasks with less computational power.
    This approach is efficient, especially when dealing with limited task-specific datasets, as the model can transfer its knowledge
    from the pre-training phase to the task at hand. 

- question: How are Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluated?
  answer: >
    <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b> are evaluated based on the ability to generate accurate and relevant responses. 
    Here are some common methods that are used to measure the performance of LLMs.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Controlled Generation Tasks</b>: These tasks assess the model’s ability to generate content under specific constraints. 
      For example, a study found that LLMs often struggle with meeting fine-grained hard constraints.</li>
      <li><b>Zero-Shot Classification Tasks</b>: In these tasks, the model is evaluated on its ability to correctly classify inputs 
      without having seen any labeled examples during training. This method is popular for evaluating LLMs as they have been shown 
      to learn capabilities during training without explicitly being shown labeled examples.</li>
      <li><b>Comparative Evaluation</b>: This involves comparing the performance of large models against smaller, fine-tuned models. 
      The comparison can reveal whether large models fall behind, are comparable, or exceed the ability of smaller models.</li>
      <li><b>Use of Evaluation Metrics</b>: Certain metrics like Sentence-BERT (SBERT), BS-F1, and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) can be 
      used with confidence when evaluating the efficacy of LLMs, particularly in generative tasks like summarization where machine/human 
      comparisons are appropriate.</li>
    </ul> 

- question: What are some applications of Large Language Models (LLMs)?
  answer: >
    Large Language Models (LLMs) have many potential applications in different domains and industries. Some of the most common 
    and promising ones are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Translation</b>: LLMs can translate texts from one language to another. 
          For example, a user can enter text into a chatbot and ask it to translate into another language, and the LLM 
          will automatically generate the translation.</li>
      <li><b>Content creation</b>: LLMs can generate various types of written content, such as blogs, articles, summaries, 
             scripts, questionnaires, surveys, and social media posts. They can also help with ideation and inspiration for 
             content creation. Additionally, some LLMs can generate images based on a written prompt.</li>
      <li><b>Chatbots and virtual assistants</b>: LLMs can power conversational agents that can interact with humans in 
          natural language, providing information, guidance, entertainment, and support. For example, ChatGPT is a popular 
          AI chatbot that can engage in a wide range of natural language processing tasks.</li>
      <li><b>Knowledge work</b>: LLMs can help knowledge workers with tasks such as information retrieval, summarization, analysis, 
          synthesis, and extraction. They can also provide insights and recommendations based on large and complex data sets.</li>
      <li><b>Malware analysis</b>: LLMs can scan and explain the behavior of scripts and files, and detect whether they are 
          malicious or not. For example, Google’s SecPaLM LLM can analyze and classify malware samples without running them in a 
          sandbox.</li>
      <li><b>Law</b>: LLMs can assist lawyers and legal professionals with tasks such as document review, contract generation, 
          compliance checking, and legal research.</li>
      <li><b>Medicine</b>: LLMs can support medical professionals and patients with tasks such as diagnosis, treatment, drug 
      discovery, clinical documentation, and health education.</li>
      <li><b>Robotics and embodied agents</b>: LLMs can enable robots and other physical agents to communicate with humans 
          and other agents, and understand and execute natural language commands.</li>
      <li><b>Social sciences and psychology</b>: LLMs can help researchers and practitioners with tasks such as data 
        collection, analysis, interpretation, and intervention. They can also generate synthetic data and texts that can be 
        used for experiments and studies.</li>
    </ul>
    These are some of the applications of LLMs that have been explored or implemented so far. However, there are 
    many more possibilities and challenges that await further research and development. LLMs are an exciting and rapidly 
    evolving field of AI that can have a significant impact on various aspects of human society and culture.

- question: What are the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)?
  answer: >
    Large Language Models (LLMs) have several limitations:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Data Dependence</b>: LLMs are trained on large amounts of data and their performance heavily depends on the quality and 
    diversity of this data. If the training data is biased or unrepresentative, the model’s outputs will likely reflect these biases.
    </li>
    <li><b>Lack of Understanding</b>: Despite their ability to generate human-like text, LLMs do not truly understand the content they are 
    generating. They do not have a concept of the world, facts, or truth, and are merely predicting the next word based on patterns 
    learned during training.</li>
    <li><b>Inability to Verify Information</b>: LLMs cannot verify the information they generate against real-world facts. 
    They do not have the ability to access real-time, up-to-date information or databases.</li>
    <li><b>Ethical Concerns</b>: LLMs can generate harmful or inappropriate content if not properly controlled. This includes 
    content that is biased, offensive, or misleading.</li>
    <li><b>Resource Intensive</b>: Training LLMs requires significant computational resources, which can be a barrier to development 
    and use.</li>
    <li><b>Lack of Creativity and Innovation</b>: While LLMs can generate text based on patterns they’ve learned, they are not 
    capable of true creativity or innovation. They cannot come up with new ideas or concepts that were not present in their 
    training data.</li>

- question: How do Large Language Models (LLMs) handle multilingual tasks?
  answer: >
    Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems that can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of 
    text data. They can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, question 
    answering, and more.
    <br>
    There are different ways that LLMs can handle multilingual tasks, depending on how they are trained and used. 
    Some common approaches are
    <ul>
      <li><b>Multilingual pre-training</b>. This involves training a single LLM on text data from multiple languages, usually with 
      a shared vocabulary and subword tokenization. This allows the LLM to learn cross-lingual representations and transfer 
      knowledge across languages. Examples of multilingual LLMs are mBERT, XLM-R, mT5, and BLOOM.</li>
      <li><b>Continued pre-training</b>. This involves further training a pre-trained LLM on additional text data from specific 
      languages or domains, to improve its performance and adaptability. For example, Tower is a multilingual LLM that is built 
      on top of LLaMA2 and continued pre-trained on 20 billion tokens of text from 10 languages.</li>
      <li><b>Multi-task fine-tuning</b>. This involves fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on multiple tasks simultaneously, using 
      task-specific prompts or instructions. This can help the LLM generalize to new tasks in a zero-shot setting, without
      requiring labeled data. For example, BLOOMZ and mT0 are multilingual LLMs that are fine-tuned on multiple translation-related tasks 
      using multi-task prompted fine-tuning.</li>
      <li><b>Adapters and parameter-efficient fine-tuning</b>. This involves adding small modules or layers to a pre-trained 
      LLM that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or languages, without affecting the original parameters. 
      This can reduce the computational cost and memory footprint of fine-tuning, and enable more flexible and modular LLMs. 
      Examples of adapter-based LLMs are AdapterHub, MAD-X, and XGLM.</li>
    </ul>
    These are some of the main methods that LLMs use to handle multilingual tasks, but there are also other aspects to 
    consider, such as data collection, evaluation, interpretability, and responsible AI.

- question: What ethical considerations are there when using Large Language Models (LLMs)?
  answer: >
    The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises several ethical considerations. Some of the most relevant ones are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>generate harmful content</b>: LLMs have the potential to create harmful content, including hate speech and extremist 
      propaganda. While they are not inherently harmful, the biases present in their training data can 
      be reflected in their outputs.</li>
      <li><b>Disinformation & Influencing Operations</b>: LLMs can inadvertently produce misinformation or be exploited for 
      disinformation campaigns.</li>
      <li><b>Weapon Development</b>:  in the wrong hands, LLMs could be used to create malicious content, including cyber
